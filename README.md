# incfile Challenge

This Node.js script, known as the "incfile challenge," is designed to perform a specific task using Puppeteer, a headless Chrome browser automation library. The code snippet you provided is just the import statement for Puppeteer, so the following README provides an overview of the project and its purpose.

## Purpose

The "incfile challenge" script uses Puppeteer to automate web interactions and data extraction from a target website. While the specific functionality of the script is not detailed in the provided code snippet, it's important to document the purpose and potential use cases of the script.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- Puppeteer: This script relies on Puppeteer for web automation. Puppeteer will be installed as a dependency when you run `npm install`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or create your project directory.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd incfile-challenge
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create the ```.env``` file using the ```.env.template``` as reference. Put your credentials to login into todoist.

## Usage

To execute the script, use the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

This command will run the script, which likely contains additional code for web automation and data manipulation.

## Notes

- **Puppeteer:** The script uses Puppeteer for browser automation. Review the script's code to understand how it interacts with websites.

- **Customization:** Depending on the actual functionality of the script, you may need to customize and configure it to your specific use case.
